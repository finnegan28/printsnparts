Yes you read that right, with this version, I have made it so that you can replace this part without the need to solder any wires!

I also sell another version that is closer to the original part, check my store to find it!


A well known fault with the Audio Technica headphones are the swivel hinges that keep your headphones fitting right.


The original part is hollow inside which causes them to fail over time, my version is 100% infilled which makes it much stronger and durable!


If you are looking at this listing, chances are your ATH-M40x has suffered a swivel hinge failure.

This nifty little replacement hinge will give your headphones a new lease of life and make them feel like new again.


You will receive 1 Swivel Hinge,

Audi A3 S3 8L 1997-2003 Headlight Tab Repair Kit,"Superior Strength and Durability than other versions!

This led me to creating my own stronger design that is able to properly support the headlight and will seamlessly fit in place of the original tabs.


They screw into the headlight housing as normal.

    2 Repair Clips
    2 Screws
